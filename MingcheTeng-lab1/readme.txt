Shopping Calculator App:

The product price should be in the range of 0 < x <= 1000000, anything that is zero dollar, then there's no need to calculate. When the product price is over 1 million, then the result will be "Exorbitant. Do not buy it".

For the discount field, it can accept the range from 0 to 100.

For the sales tax field, it can accept any input that is greater than or equal to 0. I'd like to add a cap restriction, like 100, but if there's a government that taxes people over 100%, please just find another place to live.

Negative values are not allowed for all text fields. The acceptable characters are as follows, 

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, .

And for the decimal numbers, only 2 decimal places are allowed.

Creative ideas:

▪Implement the currency exchange with pickerView. There are US dollar, Pound 			sterling, Japanese Yen, and  New Taiwan dollar.
▪A note will appear once the user select a currency other than US dollar.
▪Restrict the user inputs to only decimal numbers with up to 2 decimal places.
▪A switch button that can change language between English and traditional Chinese.
